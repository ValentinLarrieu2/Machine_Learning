In this problem, we are particularly interested in constructing a classifier that can separate a passable region from a forbidden region by learning its parameters from a given dataset.

Both data sets consist of three columns: x1 [m], x2 [m] and y [-], where (x1; x2) are 2D
cartesian coordinates, and y indicates whether a data point is of passable region (y=1) or of forbidden region (y=0).
